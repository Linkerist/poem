![usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Linkerist/poem/usage.gif)

configuration is simple,

do:
```bash
$ make menuconfig
$ make profile
$ poem <source code file>
```

choose your ideal coding style, then run poem to format source file!  
as the dynamic graph, the origin source file was written in gnu coding style, we  
want to turn it into linux kernel style, we run poem to did it.  

# Bugs?

The code was based on gnu indent, but I try to support more languages.  
Welcome issue and PR!
